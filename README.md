## Material

There is **no assignment** for this week, but we highly recommend you work through all four demos to explore each option for your final project. When you find an option you'd like to pursue, we also recommend exploring the additional resources given above.

The four lessons in this repo are organized as follows:

-   shiny_demo.md - A walk through of creating a shiny application (using data from Week 4 geospatial). [Accompanying video here.](https://youtu.be/w0HHi8yQkmM)

-   quarto_website.md - Draft a personal website in Quarto (*note that this lesson was created in a Quarto doc, and its similarity to R Markdown!*). [Accompanying video here.](https://youtu.be/af-7OZnmOJ4)

-   rmarkdown_demo.md - Tips and tricks for customizing R Markdown and creating dynamic reports (no video).

-   bookdown_demo.md - Draft a `bookdown` site to host multiple R Markdown reports/blogs. [Accompanying video here.](https://youtu.be/1N3EZ7lyeyA)
